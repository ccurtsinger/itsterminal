title: You're stranded on a desert island.

It finally happened. You've got an entire lab to do and you're stuck without a GUI. You did close Eclipse, right?

This week you'll only need the Terminal application, the name of the computer next to you (it's okay if someone is using it), and this guide. We're going to go over the UNIX terminal commands you've seen before, along with some new ones. You'll learn how to:

* Access remote machines
* Move around in the filesystem
* Create and delete directories
* Find and process files quickly
* Edit files with `emacs`

Once you know your way around, you'll learn how to create Java packages (without a GUI, of course). Finally, you'll get a chance to play with a few of the fun "easter-eggs" in the Terminal.
